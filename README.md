# Chennai_House_Price_Prediction_
This Project is to help buyers to identify a fair price for the home and also give insights to sellers as to how to build homes that fetch them more money.

# Data Cleaning
Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set.

Bad data could be:

Empty cells
Data in wrong format
Wrong data
Duplicates

# Data Analysis
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

# Encoding
Encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another. While "encoding" can be used as a verb, it is often used as a noun, and refers to a specific type of encoded data. There are several types of encoding, including image encoding, audio and video encoding, and character encoding

# Co-Relation
Correlation coefficients quantify the association between variables or features of a dataset.

# DATA SPLITTING
Data splitting is the act of partitioning available data into. two portions, usually for cross-validatory purposes. One. portion of the data is used to develop a predictive model. and the other to evaluate the model's performance

# DATA SCALING
Data Scaling is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization and is generally performed during the data preprocessing step.

# Model Fitting For Different Regression Models
*Linear Regression Model
Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). 

# Random Forest Regressor Model
A random forest regressor. A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

# KNN Regressor Model
KNN regression is a non-parametric method that, in an intuitive manner, approximates the association between independent variables and the continuous outcome by averaging the observations in the same neighbourhood.

# Decision Tree Regressor Model
Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.

# Comparing R^2 Value and Crossing Validation Score
After Comparing R^2 Value and Crossing Validation Score We get our model which analyse to find the important factors that contribute towards the price. And also it gives a forecast range (range of permissible values) rather than a single estimate as it will help the customers to negotiate.
